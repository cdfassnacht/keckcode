Code to take over after the calibration, etc., that is done by the code
in the esi directory.  There are two new classes, plus some code that deals
with combining multiple input files.  The two classes are:

* Esi2d - used to find and trace spectra, and to convert the 2d spectra into
          an output 1d spectrum in the form of an Esi1d instance.
          This class is effectively an array of Spec2d instances, plus
          some additional code that handles the complexity of a 10-member
          structure.
* Esi1d - Similar to Esi2d, but in this case effectively an array of
          Spec1d instances, plus code to deal with the 10-order structure
          of ESI data.  There is also code to combine these ten orders into
          a single Spec1d output.

            flux calibration, but most observations of the standard star

            correct even though the absolute values are not.

            doing the necessary small corrections in the overlap regions to
            make the final spectrum relatively smooth.
